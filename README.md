## Acknowledgement
This project is part of the complete Vue.js course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. I've been following Max on YouTube for a while now, and I've always found his way of teaching to be clear, and very easy to follow. I would highly recommend his courses on Udemy, and his free tutorials which can be found on YouTube for anyone wanting to learn more about JavaScript, and in particular frameworks such as Vue.
